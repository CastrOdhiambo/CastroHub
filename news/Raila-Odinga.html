      <section class="card" id="early">
        <h2>Early life & education</h2>
        <p class="lead-block">Raila Amolo Odinga was born on January 7, 1945 in Maseno, Kisumu County. The son of Jaramogi Oginga Odinga—Kenya’s first Vice‑President—Raila grew up immersed in politics. His formative years combined local influence with an education abroad that shaped both his technical skills and political outlook.</p>

        <p>He traveled to East Germany as a young man where he studied mechanical engineering at the Technische Hochschule in Magdeburg. On returning to Kenya he worked in academia and public service, including a stint as a lecturer at the University of Nairobi and senior roles at the Kenya Bureau of Standards. These early experiences—engineering training, institutional work, and a political family—laid the groundwork for a career that blended technocratic competence with political activism.</p>

        <div class="quote" style="margin-top:12px">“From the workshop to the podium: Raila’s engineering background informed the practical approach he took to infrastructure and institutional reform.”</div>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="career">
        <h2>Political career — overview</h2>
        <p class="lead-block">Raila’s political life spans more than four decades. He became a household name in Kenyan politics through sustained opposition to one-party rule in the 1980s, multiple presidential campaigns, ministerial posts, and service as Prime Minister in a power-sharing government formed after the 2007–08 post-election crisis.</p>

        <div class="two-col" style="margin-top:12px">
          <div>
            <h3>Opposition & activism</h3>
            <p>In the 1980s and 1990s, Raila emerged as a leading critic of President Daniel arap Moi’s one‑party state. He was accused of involvement in a 1982 coup plot and spent time in detention—an experience that reinforced his standing among pro‑democracy supporters. When multiparty politics returned to Kenya, he successfully contested parliamentary seats and became a central opposition figure.</p>

            <h3>Cabinet roles & Prime Ministership</h3>
            <p>Raila served in various cabinet positions, most notably as Minister for Energy. Following the disputed 2007 general election and the violence that followed, he entered into a negotiated power‑sharing agreement with President Mwai Kibaki and became the Prime Minister in April 2008. During his tenure he steered several reforms and engaged in negotiations that led to passage of the 2010 Constitution.</p>

            <h3>Repeated presidential bids</h3>
            <p>Despite multiple bids for the presidency (notably in 1997, 2007, 2013, 2017 and 2022), Raila did not succeed in winning the presidency. Each campaign, however, shaped Kenyan politics—mobilizing urban voters, pushing electoral reform and galvanizing the opposition.</p>

      <section class="card" id="achievements">
        <h2>Achievements & contributions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>2010 Constitution:</strong> A signature achievement that introduced devolution, strengthened civil liberties and restructured governance in Kenya.</li>
          <li><strong>Advancing multiparty democracy:</strong> Decades of opposition activity helped dismantle the one‑party system and broaden political participation.</li>
          <li><strong>Infrastructure & pan‑African engagement:</strong> Leveraged his engineering background to champion infrastructure projects and served in continental roles on development.</li>
          <li><strong>Political mobilization:</strong> Built a mass political movement (ODM) which reshaped national elections and political discourse.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top:12px">Why these matter</h3>
        <p class="lead-block">The 2010 Constitution changed the structure of Kenyan governance in ways that matter daily: counties with devolved budgets and authority, clearer separation of powers, and stronger rights protections. These reforms continue to influence public administration, service delivery and political competition in Kenya.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="controversies">
        <h2>Criticisms & controversies</h2>
        <p>Raila Odinga’s long political life was not without criticism. Some of the key points raised by opponents and analysts include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Electoral disputes:</strong> Multiple contested election results—particularly 2007 and 2017—left unresolved grievances in some parts of the electorate and fed tensions.</li>
          <li><strong>Allegations of polarizing politics:</strong> Detractors say Raila sometimes deepened political division by framing contests as existential struggles rather than ordinary elections.</li>
          <li><strong>Unfulfilled promises:</strong> Critics argue that despite repeated contests for the presidency, the tangible improvements in daily livelihoods for some constituencies were limited.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="muted" style="margin-top:8px">Note: Assessments of Raila are often mixed and vary significantly by region, ethnicity, class, and political affiliation.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="legacy">
        <h2>Legacy & what his death means for Kenya</h2>
        <p class="lead-block">Raila Odinga shaped Kenyan politics in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. His role in achieving the 2010 Constitution alone guarantees him a place in Kenya’s political history. His passing in October 2025 created a leadership vacuum in parts of the opposition and within ODM, while also prompting national reflection on how to carry forward the causes he championed.</p>

        <h3>Immediate political impact</h3>
        <p>With Raila’s departure, questions arise about succession in ODM, the cohesion of opposition coalitions, and how to maintain the mobilizing force he represented. Political actors will face pressure to either coalesce around new leadership or fragment into competing camps.</p>

        <h3>Longer-term remembrance</h3>
        <p>Beyond politics, Raila is likely to be remembered for the institutions he helped shape. The test of his legacy will be whether the constitutional and institutional reforms translate into persistent improvements in governance, service delivery and equality.</p>
